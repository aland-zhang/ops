目的：初探glusterfs-脑裂(split-brain)的原因
操作内容

一、场景
Rebooting the servers like this can cause split-brains.
Example:
there is a volume with two bricks brick-A on server-A, and brick-B on server-B.
Lets say server-A is brought down and while it is down file-1 is modified which needs to be healed to server-A
from server-B as soon as it is up.
Now as soon as server-A is up lets say server-B is brought down before the healing on file-1 could complete.
Now lets say file-1 is modified again.
Now when server-B comes backup, file-1 would be in split-brain.

So make sure the files are healed after a server is brought up then only reboot the other machine.


示例：
gluster 卷 gv0 成员有
server-A:/brick-A
server-B:/brick-B

server-A 宕机下线后，file-1 被修改，因此，预期 server-A 上线后，将被 server-B 修复 这个文件
此时假设：
server-A 刚上线，但 server-B 在 修复 file-1 之前，，突然也出现了宕机下线，此时，server-A 又修改了 file-1
等到：
server-B 修复上线时，将发现 file-1 处于脑裂的状态
