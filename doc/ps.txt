ps的用法简介
ps这个工具也是博大精深，各工具的详情请查看man和参考网络文章。

       -A              Select all processes. Identical to -e.
       a               Lift the BSD-style "only yourself" restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all
                       processes when some BSD-style (without "-") options are used or when the ps personality
                       setting is BSD-like. The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set
                       of processes selected by other means. An alternate description is that this option causes ps
                       to list all processes with a terminal (tty), or to list all processes when used together
                       with the x option


       -e              Select all processes. Identical to -A.

       x               Lift the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all
                       processes when some BSD-style (without "-") options are used or when the ps personality
                       setting is BSD-like. The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set
                       of processes selected by other means. An alternate description is that this option causes ps
                       to list all processes owned by you (same EUID as ps), or to list all processes when used
                       together with the a option.

       u               display user-oriented format
       
       f               ASCII-art process hierarchy (forest)
