EXAMPLES
             htpasswd /usr/local/etc/apache/.htpasswd-users jsmith

       Adds or modifies the password for user jsmith. The user is prompted for the password. If executed  on  a
       Windows  system,  the password will be encrypted using the modified Apache MD5 algorithm; otherwise, the
       system¡¯s crypt() routine will be used. If the file does not  exist,  htpasswd  will  do  nothing  except
       return an error.

             htpasswd -c /home/doe/public_html/.htpasswd jane

       Creates  a  new  file and stores a record in it for user jane. The user is prompted for the password. If
       the file exists and cannot be read, or cannot be written, it is not altered and htpasswd will display  a
       message and return an error status.

             htpasswd -mb /usr/web/.htpasswd-all jones Pwd4Steve

       Encrypts  the  password  from the command line (Pwd4Steve) using the MD5 algorithm, and stores it in the
       specified file.
