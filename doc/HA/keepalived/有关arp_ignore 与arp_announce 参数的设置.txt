在LVS环境中，常会遇到与arp_ignore、arp_announce参数相关的问题，realserver上不能主动响应针对这个vip的arp请求

  echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/lo/arp_ignore
  echo 2 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/lo/arp_announce
  echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_ignore
  echo 2 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_announce
  


arp_announce - INTEGER
        Define different restriction levels for announcing the local
        source IP address from IP packets in ARP requests sent on
        interface:
        在ip包中，用任何interface的任何本地ip来通告源ip地址
        0 - (default) Use any local address, configured on any interface
        避免将和目标ip不在同一个子网的ip作为源ip地址来通告；
        1 - Try to avoid local addresses that are not in the target's
        subnet for this interface. This mode is useful when target
        hosts reachable via this interface require the source IP
        address in ARP requests to be part of their logical network
        configured on the receiving interface. When we generate the
        request we will check all our subnets that include the
        target IP and will preserve the source address if it is from
        such subnet. If there is no such subnet we select source
        address according to the rules for level 2.
        使用最优的本地ip来响应目标。忽略ip包中的源ip，通过在所有interface上选择我们最合适的ip和目标主机通信。若没有合适的，我们选第一个本地ip
        2 - Always use the best local address for this target.
        In this mode we ignore the source address in the IP packet
        and try to select local address that we prefer for talks with
        the target host. Such local address is selected by looking
        for primary IP addresses on all our subnets on the outgoing
        interface that include the target IP address. If no suitable
        local address is found we select the first local address
        we have on the outgoing interface or on all other interfaces,
        with the hope we will receive reply for our request and
        even sometimes no matter the source IP address we announce.

        The max value from conf/{all,interface}/arp_announce is used.

        Increasing the restriction level gives more chance for
        receiving answer from the resolved target while decreasing
        the level announces more valid sender's information.

arp_ignore - INTEGER
        Define different modes for sending replies in response to
        received ARP requests that resolve local target IP addresses:
        使用任何interface上的本地ip来回应
        0 - (default): reply for any local target IP address, configured
        on any interface
        仅目标ip是本地incoming interface上配置了的ip时才回应
        1 - reply only if the target IP address is local address
        configured on the incoming interface
        仅目标ip是本地incoming interface上配置了的ip且源ip是同个子网时才回应
        2 - reply only if the target IP address is local address
        configured on the incoming interface and both with the
        sender's IP address are part from same subnet on this interface
        
        3 - do not reply for local addresses configured with scope host,
        only resolutions for global and link addresses are replied
        4-7 - reserved
        8 - do not reply for all local addresses

        The max value from conf/{all,interface}/arp_ignore is used
        when ARP request is received on the {interface}
