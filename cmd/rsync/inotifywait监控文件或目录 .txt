安装：./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install
使用记录：(被监控的目录为/tmp/575)
sosotest@JingKai_10_161_29_145:/data6/peterguo> inotifywait -mrq -e modify,delete,create,attrib /tmp/575 
如果touch /tmp/575 则输出显示如下：
/tmp/575/ ATTRIB,ISDIR 

其他选项：
Options:
        -h|--help       Show this help text.
        @<file>         Exclude the specified file from being watched.
        --exclude <pattern>
                        Exclude all events on files matching the
                        extended regular expression <pattern>.
        --excludei <pattern>
                        Like --exclude but case insensitive.
        -m|--monitor    Keep listening for events forever.  Without
                        this option, inotifywait will exit after one
                        event is received.
        -d|--daemon     Same as --monitor, except run in the background
                        logging events to a file specified by --outfile.
                        Implies --syslog.
        -r|--recursive  Watch directories recursively.
        --fromfile <file>
                        Read files to watch from <file> or `-' for stdin.
        -o|--outfile <file>
                        Print events to <file> rather than stdout.
        -s|--syslog     Send errors to syslog rather than stderr.
        -q|--quiet      Print less (only print events).
        -qq             Print nothing (not even events).
        --format <fmt>  Print using a specified printf-like format
                        string; read the man page for more details.
        --timefmt <fmt> strftime-compatible format string for use with
                        %T in --format string.
        -c|--csv        Print events in CSV format.
        -t|--timeout <seconds>
                        When listening for a single event, time out after
                        waiting for an event for <seconds> seconds.
                        If <seconds> is 0, inotifywait will never time out.
        -e|--event <event1> [ -e|--event <event2> ... ]
                Listen for specific event(s).  If omitted, all events are 
                listened for.

Exit status:
        0  -  An event you asked to watch for was received.
        1  -  An event you did not ask to watch for was received
              (usually delete_self or unmount), or some error occurred.
        2  -  The --timeout option was given and no events occurred
              in the specified interval of time.

Events:
        access          file or directory contents were read
        modify          file or directory contents were written
        attrib          file or directory attributes changed
        close_write     file or directory closed, after being opened in
                        writeable mode
        close_nowrite   file or directory closed, after being opened in
                        read-only mode
        close           file or directory closed, regardless of read/write mode
        open            file or directory opened
        moved_to        file or directory moved to watched directory
        moved_from      file or directory moved from watched directory
        move            file or directory moved to or from watched directory
        create          file or directory created within watched directory
        delete          file or directory deleted within watched directory
        delete_self     file or directory was deleted
        unmount         file system containing file or directory unmounted
