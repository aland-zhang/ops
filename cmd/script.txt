script

一、简单示例
[root@tvm02 ~]# script
Script started, file is typescript
[root@tvm02 ~]# echo a
a
[root@tvm02 ~]# history |grep wget |wc -l
10
[root@tvm02 ~]# date
Tue Jan 26 10:55:51 CST 2016
[root@tvm02 ~]# exit
exit
Script done, file is typescript
[root@tvm02 ~]# cat typescript 
Script started on Tue 26 Jan 2016 10:55:32 AM CST
[root@tvm02 ~]# echo a
a
[root@tvm02 ~]# history |grep wget |wc -l
10
[root@tvm02 ~]# date
Tue Jan 26 10:55:51 CST 2016
[root@tvm02 ~]# exit
exit

Script done on Tue 26 Jan 2016 10:55:55 AM CST


二、使用

增加到 /etc/profile 中：
exec /usr/bin/script -t 2>/var/log/user/$USER-$UID-`date +%Y%m%d%H%M`.date  -a -f -q /var/log/user/$USER-$UID-`date +%Y%m%d%H%M`.log

     Options:

     -a      Append the output to file or typescript, retaining the prior con-
             tents.

     -c COMMAND
             Run the COMMAND rather than an interactive shell.  This makes it
             easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves
             differently when its stdout is not a tty.

     -f      Flush output after each write. This is nice for telecooperation:
             One person does ‘mkfifo foo; script -f foo’ and another can
             supervise real-time what is being done using ‘cat foo’.

     -q      Be quiet.

     -t      Output timing data to standard error. This data contains two
             fields, separated by a space. The first field indicates how much
             time elapsed since the previous output. The second field indi-
             cates how many characters were output this time. This information
             can be used to replay typescripts with realistic typing and out-
             put delays.
             
     The script ends when the forked shell exits (a control-D to exit the
     Bourne shell (sh(1)), and exit, logout or control-d (if ignoreeof is not
     set) for the C-shell, csh(1)).

     Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create garbage in the type-
     script file.  Script works best with commands that do not manipulate the
     screen, the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal.
